features:
  - Support added for configuring metadata about networks
    for a cloud in a list of dicts, rather than in the
    external_network and internal_network entries. The dicts
    support a name and a routes_externally field, as well as
    any other arbitrary metadata needed by consuming
    applications.
deprecations:
  - external_network and internal_network are deprecated and
    should be replaced with the list of network dicts.
